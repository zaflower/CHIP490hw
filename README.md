# Introductions

Greetings!
I am Zainab, a Master's student in the Biomedical and Health Informatics Program. I am fascinated by **AI and Medicine**. Some project ideas I have in mind with regards to FHIR include:
1. Data visualization using the information retrieved from FHIR records and
2. Using machine learning tools to extract information from FHIR records.
